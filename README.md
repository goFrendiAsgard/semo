# What is this

Several personally useful zaruba tasks that are not part of main repository.

What semo means? [Semo is an Esperanto word for "seed"](https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=eo&text=seed&op=translate)

# How to use

```sh
# install zaruba
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/state-alchemists/zaruba/master/install.sh)"

# clone this repo
git clone git@github.com:goFrendiAsgard/semo.git /home/you/semo

# modify ZARUBA_SCRIPTS variable (put on ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export ZARUBA_SCRIPTS="${ZARUBA_SCRIPTS}:/home/you/semo
```
